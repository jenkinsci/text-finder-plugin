<div>
    Based on the change condition, the build result will be set to this value.
    Note that unless you select the <b>Allow result improving</b>
    the build result can only get worse, so you cannot change the
    result to <code>SUCCESS</code> if the current result is
    <code>UNSTABLE</code> or worse. Use <code>SUCCESS</code> to keep the build
    result from being set.

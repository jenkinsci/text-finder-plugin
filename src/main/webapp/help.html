    This plugin lets you search for some text using regular expressions in a set
    of files or the console log. Once a match is found, you can downgrade a
    successful build to a status of
    <a href="https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Result.html#UNSTABLE">unstable</a>,
    <a href="https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Result.html#FAILURE">failure</a>, or
    <a href="https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Result.html#NOT_BUILT">not built</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, you can search for the string <code>failure</code> in a set of
    log files. If a match is found, you can downgrade the build from success to
    failure. This is handy when you have some tools in your build chain that
    don't properly set the exit code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the search is always performed, even on builds which returned a
    non-zero exit status, but the reclassification only applies to builds which
    returned an overall exit status of zero.
